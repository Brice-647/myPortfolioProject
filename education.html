        <h2>High School</h2>
        <p>During high school, I built a strong foundation in problem-solving, critical thinking, and collaboration. I was actively involved in group projects, presentations, and coursework that encouraged creativity and perseverance. My early interest in technology and computers motivated me to explore programming basics and develop a curiosity for how software works. Along the way, I gained experience balancing academics with extracurricular activities, developing time management and organizational skills that continue to serve me well.</p>

        <h2>College</h2>
        <p>As a full-time student majoring in Software Development, I have expanded my technical knowledge and practical skills through coursework and independent projects. My studies have focused on programming languages such as HTML, CSS, JavaScript, Java, C#, and Python, as well as principles of object-oriented programming and software design. Beyond technical training, Iâ€™ve strengthened my ability to work collaboratively in team settings, meet project deadlines, and adapt to new challenges.
        College has also given me opportunities to grow as a problem-solver and critical thinker. Whether building small applications, debugging code, or learning new frameworks, I approach every task with a focus on efficiency, functionality, and user experience. These experiences have shaped me into a motivated learner with a passion for creating projects that combine both creativity and practicality.</p>
